/*
You are tasked with writing a function that takes a positive integer, n, as an input and returns the number of consecutive equal digits in the number. Specifically, your function should identify pairs of digits in n that are equal and consecutive and return the count of these pairs.

For instance, if n = 113224, it contains two groups of consecutive equal digits: 11 and 22. Therefore, the output should be 2. For n = 444, the output should also be 2, as there are two groups of 44 in this number.

Keep in mind that n will be a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10^8, inclusive.

Note: You are not permitted to convert the number into a string or any other iterable structure for this task. You should work directly with the number.
